# ðŸ“… Date Display Fix - Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Fixed**
The mentions page was showing today's date (when the mention was added to our database) instead of the actual publication date of the news article.

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Changed**

### **Before:**
```html
<td>
    <small class="text-muted">{{ mention.created_at[:10] }}</small>
</td>
```
- Showed: `2025-09-17` (today's date)
- This was when we added the mention to our database

### **After:**
```html
<td>
    <small class="text-muted">
        {% if mention.published_date %}
            {{ mention.published_date[:10] }}
            <br><span class="text-muted" style="font-size: 0.75em;">{{ mention.published_date[11:16] if mention.published_date|length > 10 else '' }}</span>
        {% else %}
            {{ mention.created_at[:10] }}
        {% endif %}
    </small>
</td>
```
- Shows: `2025-09-16` (actual publication date)
- Also shows time: `21:00` (publication time)
- Falls back to `created_at` if no `published_date` available

## âœ… **Result**

### **Now Shows:**
- **Date**: `2025-09-16` (actual publication date)
- **Time**: `21:00` (publication time)
- **Format**: `2025-09-16` with time below in smaller text

### **Example:**
```
2025-09-16
21:00
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **For Your Interview**

### **What to Highlight:**
1. **"I fixed the date display to show actual publication dates"**
2. **"Articles now show when they were originally published, not when we found them"**
3. **"Added proper fallback handling for missing dates"**
4. **"Improved user experience with better date formatting"**

### **Technical Details:**
- âœ… **Template logic** - Conditional display with fallback
- âœ… **Date parsing** - Shows both date and time
- âœ… **User experience** - More informative date display
- âœ… **Error handling** - Graceful fallback to creation date

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Demo**

The mentions page now shows:
- **Real publication dates** - When articles were actually published
- **Better formatting** - Date and time clearly displayed
- **Professional appearance** - Clean, readable date format

**Perfect for demonstrating attention to detail and user experience focus! ðŸŽ‰**
