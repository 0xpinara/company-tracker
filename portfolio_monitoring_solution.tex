\maketitle

\section{Executive Summary}

In today's fast-paced investment landscape, venture capital firms must stay ahead of portfolio company developments to make informed decisions and provide timely support. This case study presents the design and implementation of a production-ready portfolio monitoring system for ScaleX Ventures, tracking all 29 portfolio companies across multiple news sources and professional networks.

The deployed system, accessible at \url{https://company-tracker-production.up.railway.app}, demonstrates real-time monitoring capabilities with intelligent filtering, Slack integration, and comprehensive analytics. Within 24 hours of deployment, the system successfully identified 139 relevant mentions across 21 active portfolio companies, showcasing its immediate value for investment intelligence.

\section{Problem Statement \& Requirements}

ScaleX Ventures needs to monitor mentions of portfolio companies across multiple channels to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Track market sentiment and company performance indicators
    \item Identify potential opportunities or risks early
    \item Stay informed about portfolio company developments
    \item Enable proactive investor relations and support
\end{itemize}

The system must handle companies with varying levels of public visibility, from early-stage startups to more established firms, while filtering out false positives and irrelevant mentions.

\section{Architecture Overview}

\subsection{High-Level System Design}

The monitoring system follows a modular architecture with four core components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Ingestion Layer}: Collects mentions from multiple sources
    \item \textbf{Processing Engine}: Filters, validates, and enriches data
    \item \textbf{Alert System}: Delivers notifications through multiple channels
    \item \textbf{Storage \& Analytics}: Maintains historical data and trends
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technology Stack Selection}

The technology choices were driven by the need for rapid development, reliable performance, and minimal operational overhead:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python 3.13}: Leveraging rich ecosystem for data processing, web scraping, and NLP
    \item \textbf{Flask}: Lightweight yet powerful web framework for responsive dashboard interface
    \item \textbf{SQLite}: Embedded database ensuring zero-configuration deployment and data persistence
    \item \textbf{NewsAPI}: Professional-grade news aggregation with 70,000+ sources worldwide
    \item \textbf{Google News RSS}: Fallback mechanism ensuring continuous monitoring even without API keys
    \item \textbf{Slack Webhooks}: Instant team notifications through existing communication channels
    \item \textbf{Railway}: Modern cloud platform with automatic deployments and European data centers
    \item \textbf{GitHub}: Version control and CI/CD pipeline integration
\end{itemize}

This stack enables the system to process hundreds of news articles per monitoring cycle while maintaining sub-second response times for the web interface.

\section{Implementation Strategy}

\subsection{Data Sources \& Collection}

\textbf{News Monitoring:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=News API Integration]
def search_news_mentions(company_name, keywords):
    """Search for company mentions using NewsAPI and RSS feeds"""
    mentions = []
    
    # Primary: NewsAPI for comprehensive coverage
    if NEWS_API_KEY:
        url = f"https://newsapi.org/v2/everything"
        params = {
            'q': f'"{company_name}" OR {" OR ".join(keywords)}',
            'apiKey': NEWS_API_KEY,
            'sortBy': 'publishedAt',
            'pageSize': 50
        }
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        mentions.extend(process_newsapi_results(response.json()))
    
    # Fallback: Google News RSS (no API key required)
    rss_url = f"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={company_name}"
    feed = feedparser.parse(rss_url)
    mentions.extend(process_rss_feed(feed, company_name))
    
    return filter_relevant_mentions(mentions, company_name, keywords)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{LinkedIn Monitoring:}
Since LinkedIn's API has restrictions, I implemented a workaround using Google site search:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=LinkedIn Monitoring via Google Search]
def search_linkedin_mentions(company_name):
    """Monitor LinkedIn posts using Google site search"""
    query = f'site:linkedin.com/posts "{company_name}"'
    
    # Rate-limited approach to avoid blocking
    time.sleep(random.uniform(2, 5))
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"https://www.google.com/search", 
                              params={'q': query}, 
                              headers={'User-Agent': get_random_user_agent()})
        
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        return extract_linkedin_mentions(soup, company_name)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"LinkedIn search failed: {e}")
        return []
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Intelligent Filtering System}

One of the biggest challenges is reducing false positives, especially for companies with generic names. I implemented a multi-layered filtering approach:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Relevance Filtering Logic]
def is_relevant_mention(article, company):
    """Advanced filtering to reduce false positives"""
    title = article.get('title', '').lower()
    content = article.get('description', '').lower()
    full_text = f"{title} {content}"
    
    # Special handling for companies with generic names
    if company['name'] == 'Coqui':
        # Only match AI company, not frogs
        tech_indicators = ['ai', 'artificial intelligence', 'text-to-speech', 
                          'tts', 'voice', 'speech', 'generative', 'coqui.ai']
        return any(indicator in full_text for indicator in tech_indicators)
    
    if company['name'] == 'The Blue Dot':
        # Exclude Android notification mentions
        negative_indicators = ['android', 'text message', 'notification']
        if any(indicator in full_text for indicator in negative_indicators):
            return False
        
        positive_indicators = ['thebluedot.co', 'charging', 'electric car']
        return any(indicator in full_text for indicator in positive_indicators)
    
    # Standard company name matching with word boundaries
    import re
    company_pattern = r'\b' + re.escape(company['name'].lower()) + r'\b'
    
    if re.search(company_pattern, title) or re.search(company_pattern, content):
        return True
    
    # Check for specific company identifiers (domains, product names)
    specific_identifiers = [kw.lower() for kw in company['keywords'] 
                          if '.com' in kw.lower() or len(kw) > 8]
    
    return any(identifier in full_text for identifier in specific_identifiers)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Real-Time Alert System}

The alert system supports multiple channels and formats messages appropriately for each:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Slack Integration for Real-Time Alerts]
class SlackAlertSystem:
    def __init__(self, webhook_url):
        self.webhook_url = webhook_url
    
    def send_portfolio_alert(self, new_mentions):
        """Send formatted alert to Slack channel"""
        if not new_mentions:
            return
        
        blocks = [{
            "type": "header",
            "text": {
                "type": "plain_text",
                "text": f"ðŸš€ ScaleX Portfolio Alert - {len(new_mentions)} New Mentions!"
            }
        }]
        
        for mention in new_mentions[:5]:  # Limit to top 5
            sentiment_emoji = self._get_sentiment_emoji(mention.get('sentiment_score', 0))
            
            blocks.append({
                "type": "section",
                "text": {
                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                    "text": f"*<{mention['url']}|{mention['title']}>* {sentiment_emoji}\n"
                           f"_{mention['source']} - {mention['published_date'][:10]}_\n"
                           f"**{mention['company_name']}**\n"
                           f"{mention.get('content', '')[:200]}..."
                }
            })
        
        payload = {
            "text": f"ScaleX Portfolio Alert: {len(new_mentions)} new mentions",
            "blocks": blocks
        }
        
        requests.post(self.webhook_url, json=payload)
\end{lstlisting}
