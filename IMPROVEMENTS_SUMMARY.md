# ðŸ”§ ScaleX Ventures Portfolio Monitor - Improvements Made

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Fixed

### 1. **False Positives Reduced**
**Problem**: System was finding mentions that didn't actually mention the company (e.g., weather forecasting article for Buluttan)

**Solution**: 
- Improved relevance checking to be more strict
- Added filtering for generic terms like "weather", "forecasting", "quantum", "robotics", etc.
- Only use very specific keywords that are unique to each company
- Require company name to appear in title or content for basic relevance

### 2. **Better Keyword Filtering**
**Problem**: Generic keywords were causing false matches

**Solution**:
- Filter out common tech terms: "ai", "tech", "platform", "solution", "company"
- Filter out industry terms: "weather", "forecasting", "quantum", "computing", "robotics"
- Only use keywords longer than 5 characters
- Focus on company-specific terms like domain names and unique identifiers

### 3. **Date Parsing Improved**
**Problem**: All mentions showed "2025-09-16" (today) instead of actual publication dates

**Solution**:
- Added proper date parsing for Google News RSS feeds
- Added proper date parsing for NewsAPI articles
- Convert ISO format dates to readable format
- Fallback to original date string if parsing fails

## ðŸ“Š Results

### **Before Improvements**:
- Many false positives (weather articles for Buluttan, etc.)
- All dates showed as today
- Generic keyword matching caused irrelevant results

### **After Improvements**:
- More accurate relevance checking
- Better filtering of generic terms
- Proper date parsing (though still needs work for some sources)
- More focused on actual company mentions

- âœ… **Better accuracy** - Fewer false positives

- âœ… **Improved filtering** - Generic terms filtered out
